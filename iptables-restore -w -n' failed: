This indicates a direct rule failed to apply. Which likely means you have an invalid rule in your configuration, direct.xml. You can get more information by setting IndividualCalls=yes in /etc/firewalld/firewalld.conf. Or you can add --debug=3 in /etc/sysconfig/firewalld.

Then restart firewalld, systemctl restart firewalld.
